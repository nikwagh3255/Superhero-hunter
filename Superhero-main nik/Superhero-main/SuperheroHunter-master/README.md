# Superhero Hunter

Superhero Hunter is where we can search for our favourite super heros and villians from the comic universe. It's a project based on javascript.

We are using an API called SuperHero Api where we can get the required information about a super hero/villian.

SuperHero API: https://superheroapi.com/api/access-token/

It has multiple endpoints depending on the data we require we can access them accordingly.

To search for particular super hero/villain:

https://superheroapi.com/api/access-token/search/name

This endpoint provides us all the information about the character we wanted like Powerstats, Biography, Appearance,
Image, Connections etc..
